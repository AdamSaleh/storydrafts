* Story of the short weevil

Being a weevil is hard. You are small, always hungry and always on a lookout for predators.
You mght think that you are safe, and then you look up and see yet another pidgeon circling around.
Pindgeons are fortunately not that smart. Especially the ones livint in the city.
Weevil looks to the sky. Remembers the time when he rode a pidgeon. Pidgeon probably didn't even notice.
It was one of the pretty ones. Probably lived in the forest. Not the dirty city. And weevil looked up to the sky,
wanting to fly again.
